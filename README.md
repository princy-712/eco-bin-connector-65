# ♻️ AI Waste Detector – Eco-Bin Connector

AI Waste Detector is an intelligent waste classification system that leverages AI to identify various types of waste. The project features a React + TypeScript frontend and a Flask backend that processes waste images using a trained AI model, promoting efficient waste management.



# Hi, I'm Princy! 👋
AI Waste Detector – Eco-Bin Collector is a smart waste classification system designed to promote eco-friendly habits through the power of artificial intelligence. It allows users to upload images of waste items, which are then analyzed by a trained AI model to determine their category—such as plastic, e-waste, organic, paper, hazardous, or general waste.
Built with a modern tech stack including React + TypeScript on the frontend and Flask + Python on the backend, this project provides an intuitive and responsive user experience. The goal is to assist in proper waste segregation, reduce environmental pollution, and support sustainable living with the help of intelligent automation.

## 🎨 Frontend (React + TypeScript)

The frontend is built with React + TypeScript using Vite for fast performance.The project follows a modular structure with:

Components: Reusable UI elements (Navbar, Hero, Footer, etc.).

Pages: Different sections of the app (Index, About, Contact, etc.).

Hooks: Custom React hooks for mobile responsiveness and toast notifications.

Lib: Utility functions.

### 🛠️ Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:
```http
cd eco-bin-collector
```

Install dependencies:
```http
npm install
```
Start the development server:
## 🧠 Backend (Flask + AI Model)

The backend is powered by Flask and a trained AI model to classify waste into:

🛍 Plastic

🔋 E-waste

🌱 Organic

📄 Paper

⚠️ Hazardous

🗑 General Waste

### 🛠️ Setup

Navigate to the backend folder:
```http
cd backend
```
Create a virtual environment:
```http
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux  
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```
Install dependencies:
```http
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Flask server:
```http
python app.py
```

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  npm run deploy
```

or

Simply open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/035ac17e-244b-4dd7-b92e-fa73ad64cc05) and click on Share -> Publish.

#### I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain then we recommend using Netlify. Visit our docs for more details: [Custom domains](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain/)
  


**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```
